# Markov-chain-tweets

A C-based application that generates tweets using Markov Chain algorithms.

## Overview

This project demonstrates the application of Markov Chains for text generation, specifically tailored to simulate tweet-like messages. Developed in C, it showcases proficiency in data structures, algorithms, and file handling.

## Features

- **Markov Chain Implementation**: Generates text sequences based on probabilistic models.
- **Linked List Data Structure**: Efficient management of state transitions using custom linked lists.
- **File Handling**: Processes input text files to build the Markov model.

## Project Structure

- **linked_list.c / linked_list.h**: Implementation of a generic linked list data structure.
- **markov_chain.c / markov_chain.h**: Core logic for the Markov Chain text generation.
- **tweets_generator.c**: Main program that ties everything together and generates tweets.
- **justdoit_tweets.txt**: Sample input file containing seed text for the Markov Chain.
- **makefile**: Build instructions for the project.

## Skills Demonstrated

- **C Programming**: Advanced use of C for algorithm implementation and system-level programming.
- **Data Structures**: Creation and manipulation of custom linked lists.
- **Algorithm Development**: Design and implementation of Markov Chain-based text generation.
- **File I/O**: Reading from and writing to files for data processing.

## Future Enhancements

- **Dynamic Input Handling**: Allow users to specify different input text files at runtime.
- **Parameter Tuning**: Introduce configurable parameters for the Markov Chain, such as the order of the chain.
- **User Interface**: Develop a simple GUI or command-line options for better user interaction.
